Hi, I'm shivashri jambhale a student passionate about data science and machine learning.
I'm currently pursuing a degree in Data Science at D.Y.PATIL College Of Engineering Kasba Bawda,Kolhapur  My coursework covers statistics, programming, machine learning, and data visualization.
some basic skill
- Proficient in Python, R, and SQL
- Experience with machine learning libraries such as scikit-learn, TensorFlow, and PyTorch
- Familiarity with data visualization tools like Matplotlib and Seaborn
I'm particularly interested in exploring real-world applications of data science, including predictive modeling, natural language processing, and computer vision.
project is
# GPT2-text-generation-using-kerasnlp
This project involves building a text generation model using GPT-2 architecture with the KerasNLP library. The aim is to implement, train, and fine-tune the model to generate coherent and contextually relevant text based on input prompts. this project involves building a text generation model.
